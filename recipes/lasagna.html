    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most <em>delicious</em> dishes I've ever had in my life, this recipe is straigh from
        my grandmother's cookbook. She was born in Italy and spent the majority of her adult
        life working at a restaurant in Florence. After perfecting her cooking skills, she moved
        back to her home town of Sivoria and opened her own cafe.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe uses a traditional bechamel, rather than ricotta, and can be quite messy.
        I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do!
